# Bayesian-Particle-Tracking

This package is designed to allow bayesian analysis of particle tracking data. Specifically, it allows estimations of parameters for a diffusion process in 3D particle tracking given a trajectory. 

Currently in development:
Creating a generative model and likelihood function for data.

Future plans:
Develop a model that has dependencies on the parameters of the raw data (particle tracking images)
