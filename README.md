# Bayesian-Particle-Tracking

This package is designed to allow bayesian analysis of particle tracking data. Specifically, it allows estimations of parameters for a diffusion process in 3D particle tracking given a trajectory. 

Parameters in determining trajectory of a 3D Diffusion Process:

sigma: uncertainty in measurement on position

mu: dynamic viscosity of the medium

a: radius of the particle

T: temperature

Future plans:
Develop a model that has dependencies on the parameters of the raw data (particle tracking images)
